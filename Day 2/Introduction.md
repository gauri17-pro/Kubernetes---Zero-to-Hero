# 🧠 Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an **open-source container orchestration platform** that automates the **deployment, scaling, and management** of containerized applications. It's designed to help manage complex applications with ease, especially in dynamic environments like cloud or hybrid infrastructure.

## ♻️ Auto-Healing: Self-Correcting Applications

Kubernetes continuously monitors the health of your containers. If a container fails, becomes unresponsive, or crashes, Kubernetes will automatically replace it with a new, healthy instance.

### 🔁 Diagram:
```
[Client Request] --> [Pod A: Crashed]
                        ↓
                  [Kubernetes Health Check]
                        ↓
             [New Pod A2 Created Automatically]
```

## ⚙️ High Availability: Redundancy in Action

To prevent single points of failure, Kubernetes **distributes application workloads across multiple nodes** in a cluster.

### 📶 Diagram:
```
[User Request]
      ↓
[Load Balancer]
  ↙         ↘
[Node 1]   [Node 2]
[Pod A]    [Pod B]
```

If Node 1 fails, Node 2 still serves traffic.

## 📈 Scalability: Adapting to Demand

Kubernetes supports **horizontal scaling** — automatically adding or removing pods based on resource usage or custom metrics.

### 📊 Diagram:
```

## 📦 Automatic Bin Packing

Kubernetes schedules containers based on their **resource requirements** and the **available capacity** on nodes.

### 🧩 Diagram:
```
[Pod A: CPU-100m, RAM-200Mi] → Node 1
[Pod B: CPU-200m, RAM-300Mi] → Node 2
[Pod C: CPU-100m, RAM-100Mi] → Node 1 (remaining space)
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

Kubernetes supports several advanced deployment strategies:

### 🔁 Rolling Updates
Gradually replaces old version with the new one.

### 🟢🔵 Blue-Green Deployment
Two environments — Blue (current), Green (new). Switch when Green is stable.

### 🐦 Canary Deployment
Releases the new version to a small percentage of users first.

### 📊 Strategy Comparison Table

| Strategy           | Risk Level | Rollback | Use Case                         |
|--------------------|------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Rolling Update     | Medium     | Easy     | Continuous delivery               |
| Blue-Green         | Low        | Instant  | Zero downtime updates            |
| Canary             | Very Low   | Granular | A/B testing, critical systems     |

## 🔁 Auto Rollout & Rollback

When a new version is deployed:

- Kubernetes automates the update.
- Monitors for errors or crashes.
- If issues are detected, it **automatically rolls back** to the last stable version.

---

## 🔐 Secrets & Configuration Management

Kubernetes handles sensitive information (like passwords, tokens, etc.) using:

- **Secrets** – Encrypted storage of sensitive data
- **ConfigMaps** – Storing non-sensitive configs like environment variables

---

## 🔒 Security in Kubernetes

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Defines **who can access what**, using roles and permissions.

### Namespaces
Used to logically isolate workloads and users.

### Network Policies
Control how pods can communicate with each other and outside the cluster.

## ❓ Is Kubernetes Right for You?

Kubernetes is powerful, but might be **overkill** if:

- Your project is small and doesn’t need scaling
- You don’t have a dedicated DevOps team
- Your application has very low traffic
